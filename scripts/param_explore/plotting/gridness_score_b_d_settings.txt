to make the combined plot from 4 plots I used the same
colorbar scale in each plot.
it was caxis([0 0.4]).
this kept the colors consistent.

Other settings ended up being consistent as well:
plot_rotation_factor_1=100000;
plot_rotation_factor_2=200000;
rev_axes_y=1; % reverse axes plotting direction
rev_axes_x=1;
